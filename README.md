## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This prework for the Coding Boot Camp is necessary for me to get a grasp on the basics of JavaScript coding
- It helped me refresh my memory on HTML and CSS and introduce me further to JavaScript
- I created a study guide that I can add to so I can refer to it whenever I need to during the boot camp
- I learned more about Git than I ever knew, how to create and merge branches, pull requests, and some JavaScript elements that I didn't know before.

## Usage

Each section will contain notes as I see fit to add them in order for me to get down some of the important parts that make up the core of this boot camp. Each section contains notes about a certain topic, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
